# Shopping Mall
(The goal...)

## How to start   
`git`, `nodejs` and `npm` installation are required.
1. git clone {this repository}
2. npm install (at the root folder of the project)
3. node app.js (-> server running)

## Git branch rules
- main: For prod version. 
- release: For dev version.

Only `main` branch version must be working at Cloud(EC2). `release` version and any other branch's version should be developed in the local because EC2 has a limit of 750 hours per 1 month. So we should minimize the use of the server.

## Schedule
- May: Complete backend 
- June: Complete frontend
